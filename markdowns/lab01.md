# Lab 1 Introduction to the Lab (20th September 2018)

<h4>Using Eclipse Open Source Tool</h4>
<p>Eclipse Open Source is a Java-based, open source development platform developed by IBM. It is simply a framework and a set of services for building applications from plug-in components. It provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for building Java programs. Editing, compiling, building, debugging and online help are integrated in one graphical user interface. You just need to enter your source code or open an existing source code in one window then click a button or a function key to compile the source code.</p>

<h4>Downloading and Installing Eclipse IDE</h4>
<p>The installation of Eclipse is very straightforward. There is no installation program. Instead you just create the top-level folder and then unzip the file inside this folder. To install Eclipse IDE on your computer, you need to:
  
  1. Download Eclipse installer from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. Find the suitable version of your Eclipse IDE to your computer and operating system. Eclipse is hosted on many mirrors around the world. Please select the one closest to you and start to download the Installer.
  2. Start the Eclipse Installer executable once the download has finished.
  3. The new Eclipse Installer shows the packages available to Eclipse users. You can search for the package you want to install or scroll through the list. Select and click on the package you want to install. For this class, choose "<b>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</b>". 
  4. Specify the folder where you want Eclipse to be installed. The default folder will be in your User directory. Select the ‘<b>Install</b>’ button to begin the installation. You have successfully installed the latest version of the Eclipse IDE and ready to be explored!
</p>

<h4>Eclipse IDE Workbench</h4>
<p>To open the Eclipse program, you need to:
  1. Start Eclipse by double-click the eclipse.exe file in the directory which you unzipped the Eclipse program before or double click your created eclipse shortcut. It will ask you to specify a default workspace to store all your Java programs later.
  At this point, you can choose directory and create new folder for your workspace. Also, instead of default name “workspace”, you can rename it. To choose or create new folder for workspace in specified directory, do the steps follows:
a. Click Browse
b. Use existing folder/directory, choose specified folder and then click Ok. Or
c. Create new folder, choose folder where you intend to create your workspace and then
click Make New Folder and named your new folder. Click Ok to finish.
2. After you choose the workspace, a “Workbench” window will be opened and a Java perspective is displayed with only the “Welcome” screen visible. A “Workbench” window consists of one or more perspectives. A perspective contains editors and views, such as the
Project Explorer.
