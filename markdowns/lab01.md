Using Eclipse
Eclipse Open Source is a Java-based, open source development platform developed by IBM. It is simply a framework and a set of services for building applications from plug-in components. It provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for building Java programs. Editing, compiling, building, debugging and online help are integrated in one graphical user interface. You just need to enter your source code or open an existing source code in one window then click a button or a function key to compile the source code.
